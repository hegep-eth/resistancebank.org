                    "The data presented in Resistance bank come with limitations. The first set of limitations concerns the quality of the event-based surveillance data and comparability across surveys.
                    In the human population, the majority of studies focus on diagnostic samples taken mainly from sick patients. In contrast, in animals, surveillance relies on different
                    data collection contexts: sampling of living versus dead animals, sampling of animal food products, outbreak investigation, sample collection required by food regulatory authorities, etc.",
                    tags$br(),
                    "These different sampling contexts, which are inherent to event-based surveillance, represent a challenge to the harmonization and the interpretation of resistance rates reported on this
                    platform. In particular, the surveys listed on Resistance bank may differ in terms of i) sampling strategy (random or convenient), ii) animal breeds and farming systems, iii)
                    the number of isolates tested per survey, iv) the panels of antimicrobials used for susceptibility testing, and v) the degree of aggregation used for reporting antimicrobial rates in each
                    survey (population versus isolate-level information). For these reasons, in Resistance bank, we allow users to specify additional surveys information such as the sampling scheme,
                    the guidelines, and breakpoints used for susceptibility testing, the quality control strains used, etc., to include as much information about these factors that may affect the
                    interpretation of the resistance rates reported.", tags$br(),
                    tags$br(),
                    "Other limitations concern the intensity of our data collection efforts between countries. Our online literature search was supplemented by field officers who collected point-prevalence
                    surveys on paper during visits to veterinary schools. However, these field visits could only be conducted in India, where our collaboration network is extensive. Collaboration with
                    international organizations could help leverage a larger network of field officers to supplement the information currently in resistanbank.org. We conducted the literature searches
                    in six languages (English, Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, French, Portuguese, and German). Although these languages are spoken by 46.6% of the world population, further inquiries in other
                    languages could help supplement our database.", tags$br(),
                    "Finally, the computational cost of re-running the geospatial model is currently preventing instantaneous updates of the AMR map on a global level
                    and should be the focus of future research efforts to move from yearly updates of our maps to daily updates. For the reasons listed above, Resistance bank is an imperfect surrogate to systematic
                    surveillance systems. It is a platform reporting large-scale trends in antimicrobial resistance meant to help international funders to target their efforts in the short term and
                    facilitate the development of a global systematic surveillance system in the long term.", tags$br(),
